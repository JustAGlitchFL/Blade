# Blade
Ultra-thin upcycled peripherals

## The Idea
Having used a Surface Book 2 for 3 years (that I got refurbished for $500 in 2022), I came to love the keyboard on this machine. It is by far the best laptop/low profile keyboard I have ever used. Similarly, the 5 inch glass Synaptic touchpad isn't the largest, but is super smooth and very nice to use. I have often connected my SB2 to my desktop to use it as a primary peripheral for writing projects, and pretty much anything that wasn't gaming. However, the ribbon cable link between the lower keyboard portion (keyboard, IO, battery) and the tablet portion (mainboard, small battery, display) has degraded. This increasingly caused the laptop to be entirely unusable besides the touchscreen intermittently, and recently it has been ejecting the display from the base when powered on. I am keeping the upper half of this device as a tablet, but it seemed wasteful to throw away such high quality hardware.

## Introducing Blade
Blade is a project to develop the thinnest possible bluetooth wireless peripherals using upcycled laptop components, specifically the keyboard and trackpad salvaged from my SB2.
